# Database Schema & Constraints

## We need to convert our designs and tables to a physical design in our DBMS using `SQL`

## What's SQL?
Structured query language is a programming language used in the database. it's divided into three parts DDL, DML, DCL.

## What's a data schema?
- It's a group of related objects in the database.
- There is one owner of a schema who has access to manipulate the structure of any object in the schema. 

## What's a data type?
- A data type determines the type of data that will be stored in the database column.

## What's a data constraints?
- restrictions on the database table or object to maintain integrity of data.
- constrains:
     - primary key

     - Referential integrity works with insert or delete
         - if i have to insert: insert in the parent record(record that has primary key) first then in the child record(record that has foreign key).
         - if i have to delete: delete the table with foreign key first then the primary key

    - check constraints 
         - if the salaries have to be between 10,000 and 12,000 then it will check the maximum and minimum of field.
