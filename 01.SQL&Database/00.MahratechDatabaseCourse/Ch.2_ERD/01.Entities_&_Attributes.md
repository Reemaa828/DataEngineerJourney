if i want to describe the employees as an entity with attributes; we represent entity in an rectangular shape and attributes in an oval shape

- attribute can be a single/simple attribute that has a single value.
- attribute can be a multi-valued attribute that has multiple value represented as a double oval shape.

- attribute can be a composite attribute; an attribute that can be divided into smaller subparts.

- to identify a unique attribute we underline it; they are called candidate keys if an entity has more than one key in the entity.

- strong entity: one of it attributes is unique
- weak entity: 
1. none of it attributes are unique
2. this entity depends on the existence of another entity.
