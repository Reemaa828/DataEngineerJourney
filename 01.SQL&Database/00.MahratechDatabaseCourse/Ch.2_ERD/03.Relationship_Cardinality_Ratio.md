second thing we need to define is the cardinality ratio.

## How is it done?
by asking myself questions on the relationships.
- does employee work in one department or many?
- is the department worked by one employee or many?

- in a ternary relationship i assume i have three binary relationship then do cardinality ratio.

>[!TIP]
>- in the ternary relationship each side must be the same, if they differ then i have to change the ternary relationship into a closed loop.
