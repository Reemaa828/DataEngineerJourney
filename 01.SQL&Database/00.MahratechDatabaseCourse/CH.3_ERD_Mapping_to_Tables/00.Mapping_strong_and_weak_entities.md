## after creating the conceptual design; it's time to create the logical design.

## What's a relation database?
its a table or a relation consists of tuple, columns and it's intersection called domain.

## What's a primary key?
it's a special column or a set of columns that has two characteristics :
1. it must contain a unique value for each row of data 
2. it's value cannot be null

## Mapping of regular entity types
#### 1. creating a table for each entity
for example: Emp(ID, ~~SSN~~, Zone, Street)

for single/simple attributes

for multi-valued attribute; we put it in a separate table with the primary key as a foreign key? a foreign key reference the primary key in another table.
Emp - phone (SSD, phone)

for derived attribute; by default we don't include it in the database cause it will cause headache? because every time we use the employee table, it will be calculated. so it slows down the performance and delays of retrievals.
we can store it only if we need  to retrieve it a lot or use that data.
#### 2. choose a primary key from key attributes of entity
usually we choose the shortest combination or the one that would take the least storage.
composite primary key: a primary key that consists of more than one attribute

## Mapping of weak entity types
#### 1. the same steps of [Mapping of regular entity types](##mapping-of-regular-entity-types) but by taking the primary key of the owner entity and put it as foreign key.
