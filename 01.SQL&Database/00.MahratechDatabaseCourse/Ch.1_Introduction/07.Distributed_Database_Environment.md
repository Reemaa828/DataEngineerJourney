# Distributed Database Environment
## Why do we need a Distributed Database Environment?
- high availability of the database
- if my database is critical and we cannot wait for it's down time cause it will cost money
- if the database is critical and cannot lose transaction 
- if the system used in long distance (for support)
## Types of distributed database environment
1. replication: having copies of database server
2. fragmentation: dividing the database into sections
## Replication
there are two ways: partial replication and full replication
**full replication**: there will be a full replication of database server and between them a signal/heart beat if one stops working, the other takes control.
**partial replication**: there will be a specific part of the database that is copied

## Fragmentation
the database will be divided into fragments of data, the fragments taken will either be horizontal fragments or vertical fragments or even hybrid.

the fragments will either be the rows of data or columns of data or a mix

## Advantages
- high availability of database
- the database is no longer the single point of a failure
## Disadvantages
- cost more money (each distribution will need installation and setup of DBMS )
