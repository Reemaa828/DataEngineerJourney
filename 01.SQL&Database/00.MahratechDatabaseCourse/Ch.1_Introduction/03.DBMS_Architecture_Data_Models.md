# DBMS Architecture , Data Models
## What's a Database Management System Architecture?
It's a three schema architecture:
1. external schema: we can have more than one external schema depending on types of users, so each external schema is for a specific type of user and how will the data be presented to this user also the external schema are concerned with what data the user will see. we can also say it's the final data that a specific type of users can access or see.
2. conceptual schema: it's the logical model, it's concerned with what is represented (the table, the dB objects, the database structure) 
3. physical schema: explains the allocation of the data on the disk (the data is group of files store on the hard disk) we can also say it's a map to how the data is located on hard disk, it shows the physical path on file and where it's physically located on the hard disk and the space used and free. how the data in the database represented and how the data structure implemented.

## What's Data Models?
1. Logical model: it represents the conceptual schema that contains the full design of the database
2. Physical model: explains how the data is stored on hard disk and the access paths of these data.
>[!TIP]
>why is schemas separated?
>for data independence: the higher levels are not affected by the changes of the lower levels
