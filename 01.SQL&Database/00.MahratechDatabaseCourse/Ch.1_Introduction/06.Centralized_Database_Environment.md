# Centralized Database Environment
Centralized Database Environment: the database is on one server.

# Mainframe Environment
Having a mainframe and all the other monitors are connected to it via a 'dummy terminal'; which means that one machine will contain database server and application server also it will do all the processing .

- terminal doesn't do any processing but requests only.
- processing depends on one server
- the performance is very slow
- the database server and application server has a single point of failure(if mainframe is down all the other systems on the monitors are also down)
# Client/Server Environment
It's a two tier environment; a database server and a thick client(means that the application is locally installed and set up on the client machine)

- the database is the single point of failure
- the application is no longer a single point of failure
- high cost of maintenance and support( updating an application should show on every end user machine) 
# Internet Computing Environment
it's a three tier environment

- the database server is the single point of failure
- lower cost of maintenance and support

## When do you need more than one application server?
when the load is high; there are many users so we can distribute the users on it.
or many application servers but separated for example: each department will have it's own application server but they're all connected to the same database.

# What's Disadvantages of Centralized Database Environment?
- if the database is disconnected or an
- abnormal termination happened then all the system will be down which will take time to restart the system from the beginning.
