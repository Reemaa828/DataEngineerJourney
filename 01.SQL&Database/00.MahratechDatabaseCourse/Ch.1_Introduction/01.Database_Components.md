## Application:
It's interface that end user uses to access the database.

## DBMS Software:
It's divided into two parts
1. software that process the queries.
2. software that access the stored data and that can manipulate(edit, add, return) the stored data.

## Database:
It's divided into two parts
1. stored database definition (metadata)
metadata is a set of information about my data

## Database System Advantages
1. avoiding redundancy of data
2. providing backup and recovery
3. Inconsistency can be avoided (the update will be seen)
4. Enforcing integrity constrains (if a column needs a special kind of data only that should be used)
5. Access privileges 

## Database System Disadvantages
1. need expertise to use
2. DBMS is expensive (the cost of software and the infrastructure)
3. may be incompatible with other available DBMS


>[!TIP]
>The concept of having metadata for my database allow me to transfer from DBMS to another DBMS.
