## Example on `create` command
this is the relational database model that we will use to create our database.
![Pasted image 20241003145743](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1778db26-518d-493b-a8cc-5fc48ca291a5)

```sql
use master;
create database sales;
```
these lines are used for creating a database called sales with the use of the master database; which records the system-level information of any instance in the SQL server.
```sql
drop database sales;
```
this line is used for deleting the database.
- if we clicked on the properties of the created database we will find that it matches the model database (the default database).

- if we want to change the default properties
```sql
use master;
create database sales 
on 
	( NAME = sales_data,
     FILENAME = 'E:/sales.mdf',
	 SIZE = 10,
	 FILEGROWTH = 50,
	 MAXSIZE = 100
	)
log on 
( NAME = sales_log,
FILENAME = 'E:/sales_log.ldf',
SIZE = 10,
FILEGROWTH = 50,
MAXSIZE = 100 ) ;
```

# Creating schemas 
## What's a schema?
 A **schema** refers to the structure that defines the organization, relationships, and constraints of data within a database.
### Types of Schemas:
1. **Logical Schema**: Defines the logical structure of the data, such as tables, views, and relationships, without concern for how the data is physically stored.
2. **Physical Schema**: Defines how the data is physically stored in the system, including disk storage, file systems, indexes, etc.
3. **Conceptual schemas**: offer a big-picture view of what the system will contain, how it will be organized, and which business rules are involved.
>[!TIP]
>- is it mandatory to create a schema?
>-  No, it is not strictly mandatory to create a schema when setting up a database, but it is **highly recommended** for several reasons, especially when dealing with relational databases.
>- ###### When and Why You Should Create a Schema:
>1. **Data Organization**: A schema helps to organize your data in a structured way, defining how data should be stored, related, and accessed.
>2. **Data Integrity**: Schemas enforce rules and constraints on the data, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and data types, helping maintain the quality and consistency of the data.
>3. **Scalability**: A well-designed schema allows your database to grow and evolve without major structural changes. It can accommodate more data and new features with ease.
>4. **Collaboration**: A schema acts as a shared blueprint for developers, analysts, and database administrators, making it easier to work on and manage the database together.
>5. **Performance**: A schema can include indexes and other optimizations that make querying and retrieving data faster.

to execute these lines correctly you need to execute them statement by statement.
```sql
use sales;
create schema sales_schema ;
create schema production ;
```

# Create table

## What's a table
it's the main data structure in the database.

## How to create a table?
this is the main syntax
```sql
create table [IF NOT EXISTS ][database_name.][schema_name.] table_name (
col1 datatype [constraints],
col2 datatype [constraints],
col3 datatype [constraints] [ DEFAULT default_value ]
)
```
 Each column has a name, the type of data allowed in that column, an _optional_ table constraint on values being inserted, and an optional default value.

If there already exists a table with the same name, the SQL implementation will usually throw an error, so to suppress the error and skip creating a table if one exists, you can use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause.
##  Datatypes used in SQL server
![Pasted image 20241004121503](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc909c3-d8f7-43f1-9dcf-515469f62d14)


```sql
use sales ;
GO

create table sales_schema.customers 
(
customer_id int not null,
first_name varchar(15) not null,
last_name  varchar(15) not null,
email varchar(50) not null,
phone varchar(15),
state varchar(15),
city varchar(15) not null,
street varchar(30) not null,
zip_code varchar(5)
) ;
```

>[!TIP]
>- we can write the statements in one line but it's a better practice to do follow indentation.
>- it's a better practice to make entity's name in plural .
>- we use `varchar` instead of `char` if we don't know the specific size of string.
>- we use `text` for paragraphs.
>- we use `varchar` if it's a numeric value that we will not use in arithmetic operations like phone numbers or citizen identification number.

# Constraints 

## Types of constraints
-  Primary key constraint
-  Foreign key constraint
-  Unique constraint
-  Check constraint
-  Null constraint

## Primary key constraint
- A primary key is a column or a group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- It have to be **not** **null** and a **unique** data.
this is the informal way where `sql server` will create a name for `pk constraint`  , you will need to do a query to retrieve it's name .

```sql
--informal way (column level) to write constraints 
create table [IF NOT EXISTS ][database_name.][schema_name.] table_name (
col1 datatype primary key
)
```
this is the formal way where you(database owner) will create a name for `pk` , which is a better practice.

```sql
--formal way (table level) to write constraints
create table [IF NOT EXISTS ][database_name.][schema_name.] table_name (
col1 datatype ,
constraint [name_constraint] primary key ( col1 )
)
```

>[!TIP]
>- Each table can contain only one primary key
>- In case the primary key has two or more columns, you must use the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint as a table constraint: `primary key (col1 , col2 )`

________

# Constraint 2

## Unique constraint
- it's value cannot be duplicated in the same table.
this is the column level way to make an attribute with a unique constraint
```sql
--informal way (column level) to write constraints 
create table [IF NOT EXISTS ][database_name.][schema_name.] table_name (
col1 datatype unique
)
```
this is the table level way to make an attribute with a unique constraint
```sql
--formal way (table level) to write constraints
create table [IF NOT EXISTS ][database_name.][schema_name.] table_name (
col1 datatype ,
constraint [name_constraint] unique ( col1 )
)
```
![Pasted image 20241004143803](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf94590-2147-41b7-9d3e-feeba05b8996)
__________
# Constraint 3

## Check constraint
- check conditions on the inserted data.
this is the column level way to make a check constraint on the column
```sql
create table table_name
(
col1 datatype check (col1 between 21 and 33) --or you can do any other conditions
);
```
this is the table level way to make a check constraint on the column
```sql
create table table_name
(
col1 datatype,
constraint table_name check (table_name between 22 and 244)
);
```

![Pasted image 20241004150735](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17218f7-d495-4147-9607-3c2123c7651c)

```sql
use sales;
go

create table sales_schema.staffs
(
staff_id int primary key,
first_name varchar(20) not null,
last_name varchar(20) not null,
salary numeric(7,2) check (salary between  3000 and 15000),
hire_date date
);
```
>[!TIP]
>- numeric datatype is used for decimal numbers `numeric(digits,decimal_digits)` numeric(7,2) means 7 overall digits with 2 digits after decimal point.
>- we can use any conditions other than `between and `
>- we cannot check on another column ,only the column where we used the check constraint on.
> for example: salary numeric(7,2) check (staff_id between  3000 and 15000) --wrong

# Constraint  4

## Foreign Constraint
-  in a relationship `one to many` , the primary key of the `one table` will be the foreign key of the `many table`.
- the foreign key is a reference to the parent table usually the primary key column.
- the value of the foreign key must exist in the primary key that the foreign key refers to, otherwise an error will occur.
- The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity. It means that you can only insert a row into the child table if there is a corresponding row in the parent table.
- it can be null.
for example:

![Pasted image 20241004185220](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d6eb8d-1a46-4a36-a6ce-9c8d1c8babff)

## How to create a foreign key?
just like any other constraints but with reference to the parent table and it's primary key attribute.
```sql
constraint foreign_key_name foreign key (col1, col2,....)
references parent_table_name (coll1, coll2,....);
```

![Pasted image 20241004191740](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a0a6c0-f440-4827-8e87-354e5202e02d)

```sql
use sales;
go

create table sales_schema.stores
(
store_id int primary key,
store_name varchar(30) not null,
city varchar(30) not null,
phone varchar(30)
);
create table sales_schema.staffs
(
staff_id int primary key,
first_name varchar(20) not null,
last_name varchar(20) not null,
salary numeric(7,2) check (salary between  3000 and 15000),
hire_date date,
store_no int,
constraint stores_staffs_fk foreign key (store_no)
references sales_schema.stores (store_id)

);
```

# Alter table command

- modify and change the structure of the table but not the data.

## What can we modify using `alter` statement?
- we can add a new column.
```sql
alter table table_name
add col1 datatype,
col2 datatype,
col3 datatype ;
```
- we can make changes on the datatype and it's size.
```sql
alter table table_name
alter column column_name new_datatype(size) ;
```
also we can change it to `not null` or `null`
```sql
alter table table_name
alter column column_name not null;
```
- rename column
```sql
EXEC sp_rename 'table_name' , 'new_table_name'; --you add the schema's name only in the first argument
EXEC sp_rename 'table_name.attribute' , 'table_name.new_attribute_name' , 'COLUMN'; --column must be capital
--example
exec sp_rename 'sales_schema.d' , 'workers' ;
exec sp_rename 'sales_schema.workers.first_name' , 'name' , 'COLUMN';
```
- drop column
```sql
alter table table_name
drop column col1;
```
- add constraints
```sql
alter table table_name
add constraint constraint_name unique (attribute);
```
- drop constraints
```sql
alter table table_name
drop contraint constraint_name 
```

>[!TIP]
>- we cannot convert from different datatypes
>for example: from string to int
>![Pasted image 20241004202549](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/901bd88d-c7e7-4f43-b07a-0990bbe6f99d)

______
>[!NOTE]
>- use `check (column_name in ('','','',........)` to make the check condition allow  any of the values between in the brackets.
>- use `identity(number, increment)` to make the DBMS itself put the values and increment them.
