_________

## Update Command
syntax to update multiple columns 
```sql
update table_name
set  col1 = 'c' , col2 = 'v', col3= 'o';
```
if you wrote this without `where` clause it will change the value of every fields.

![Pasted image 20241006111022](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b7bf9af-6ac0-4ce4-b7d4-7286feccbd4c)


to specify the fields:
```sql
update table_name
set col1='0' , col2='v', col3='b'
where col_id=1;
```

___________

## Delete command
this line will delete all data in the table.
```sql
delete from table_name
```
for example:

![Pasted image 20241006221738](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b3b05de-2025-4018-89f4-9d9f674abb3f)
___________

## Select Command


```sql
select * from  table_name --retrieve all data 

select col1,col2 from table_name --retrieve all data  in these fields

select * from table_name where col=3; --retrieve data only if the condition is true

select * from table_name where col1=2 and col2=3; --both conditions must be true

select * from table_name where col1=2 or col2=3; --either conditions must be true
--operators that can be used with where clause >, <, >=, <=, !=, =.
```
```sql
select * from table_name where col1 in('rir','remma',...); --retrieve data where col1 is either rir or remma

select * from table_name where col1 not in('rir','remma',..); --retrieve data where col1 is anything except rir or remma

select * from table_name where col1 is null; -- retrieve all data where col1 is null

select * from table_name where col1 is not null; --retrieve all data where col1 is any value except null

select * from table_name where col1 between 200 and 300; --retrieve all data where col1 values is =>200 and <=300

select * from table_name where col1 not between 200 and 300; --retrieve all data where col1 values is not between 200 and 300

```
```sql
select distinct col1 from table_name; --retrieve data where col1 is not duplicated

select distinct col1,col2 from table_name; --retrieve data where col1,col2 both are not duplicated together
```
____________
## `Like` clause
- should be used when i don't know what I'm specially looking for.
- like is used with patterns
```sql
select * from table_name
where col1 like 'pattern'
```
or it's opposite
```sql
select * from table_name
where col1 not like 'pattern'
```

### patterns using wildcards
- `%` pattern for zero or more characters

  ![Pasted image 20241006224001](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd103b1d-351c-4f99-ba49-64a43896115a)

# join

## What's a join?
AÂ `JOIN`Â clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

## There are different types of join
- inner join
- left join
- right join
- full join

## Inner join
-Â Returns records that have matching values in both tables
- Â `INNER`Â is the default join type forÂ `JOIN`, so when you writeÂ `JOIN`Â the parser actually writesÂ `INNER JOIN`.

![Pasted image 20241006140030](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c09265-6377-41cb-a9ba-82ed8f711e03)


### Syntax inner join
```sql
select *
from categories c join products p
on c.id = p.id --join condition
```
or
```sql
select *
from categories c, products p
where c.id = p.id --join condition
```
>[!TIP]
>- `natural join` is an inner join without the join condition but it's not supported in SQL server.
>- concatenation : col1 + '  ' + col2 


_________

## Outer Join
- `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
- `RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
- `FULL (OUTER) JOIN`: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
  
![Pasted image 20241006144729](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1cc2f94-cb88-4d14-9b6a-e9103bb69d31)

____________

## Aggregate functions
- a built-in functions
  
[SQL Server Aggregate Functions (sqlservertutorial.net)](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-aggregate-functions/)

example:

![Pasted image 20241006150804](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6853ae4c-e55d-48fb-87df-e4e082466a88)


______________

## Grouping data `group by`clause
- grouping a column for certain queries
for example:
you want to group data by `category_id` and calculate the count, maximum, minimum, and average of prices in each category.

![Pasted image 20241006151814](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88c39083-31ba-4239-bd9d-982a061aa101)


- we filter the grouped rows by using `having` clause
```sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, â€¦ FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column 
HAVING group_condition;
```
- theÂ `HAVING`Â clause constraints are written the same way as theÂ `WHERE`Â clause constraints
- TheÂ `GROUP BY`Â statement is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`,Â `MAX()`,Â `MIN()`,Â `SUM()`,Â `AVG()`) to group the result-set by one or more columns

___________

## `select top` command
- TheÂ `SELECT TOP`Â clause allows you to limit the rows or percentage of rows returned by a query.
- theÂ `SELECT TOP`Â statement should always be used with theÂ [ORDER BY](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-order-by/)Â clause.
```sql
SELECT TOP (expression) [PERCENT]
    [WITH TIES]
FROM 
    table_name
ORDER BY 
    column_name;
```
or with percentage
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 PERCENT
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM
    production.products
ORDER BY 
    list_price DESC;
```
or with ties
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 WITH TIES
    product_name, 
    list_price
FROM
    production.products
ORDER BY 
    list_price DESC;

```
`TOP WITH TIES`, it returns three additional products with the same list prices as the third one.
______________

# Nested Query (sub query)
- it's a query within another query `query(sub query)`
### use keyword `all, any , in` if the sub query returns more than one value


![Pasted image 20241007170735](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9688370b-132b-4698-9063-8f4b07e6a892)


_____________

#  Views
- it's a database objects
- it's treated as a virtual table, it doesn't have a physical existence.
- usually used for security 
- `views` are always up to date.
- it's made to save complex queries in a data object.
  
![Pasted image 20241007175126](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6335d928-19a0-45e7-8f11-fa2c8ca92dc7)

```sql
create view view_name
as
query
```
![Pasted image 20241007175854](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9eef8fd-8828-46c8-9965-5467ea86f768)

we can use the view as a table


![Pasted image 20241007175930](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77ada7b8-2a5a-49df-b23c-01a6db1eaf7e)

![Pasted image 20241007180154](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/260dea6e-dd4f-45cc-9d94-03757c010de2)


- we can insert data in the view but we must include in the view the primary key, `not null `columns.
