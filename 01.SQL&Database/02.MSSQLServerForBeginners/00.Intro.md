it's responsible for the structure of the database such as creating tables or any database object, deleting and altering the tables or any database objects.

it's auto-committed meaning any changes done to the tables are permanently saved in the databases. 
- DML: Data Manipulation Language
  
it's responsible for the data itself, DML commands are used to modify the database such as `insert` , `update`, `delete`...

it's not auto-committed meaning that any changes done to the tables are not permanently saved in the databases. 

It can be rolled back (backed up).
