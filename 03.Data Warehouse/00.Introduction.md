# Data Warehouse Introduction
# What's Business intelligence (BI)?
- It's the activity that contributes to the growth of any company.
- it's the act of transforming raw/operational data(live data) into useful information for business analysis.
## how does it work?
- Bi is based on Data warehouse technology extracts information from the company's operational systems.
- the data is transformed (cleaned (removing duplicates, fixing errors) and integrated (combining data from different systems into a single format)) and loaded into data warehouse.
- Since the data is credible(acceptable/valid), it's is used for business insights.

# Why is Data Warehouse needed? 🏚️
- Data is collected from various sources, stored in various databases cannot be directly visualized.
- Data must be integrated and processed before visualization takes place.

# So, what's a Data Warehouse? 🤔
- It's a centralized location where consolidated(combined) data from multiple locations are stored.
- DWH is maintained separately from operational databases.
- operational Databases are updated frequently but DWH is updated at a scheduled intervals.
- DWH is not loaded everytime the operational databases are updated.
- DWH data is legacy data, data there is not changed/modified or deleted.
- End users can access the DWH whenever an information is needed.
_______

## Difference between Databases and DWH 🗭
- **DWHs have more interlinked data** because they integrate data from **multiple sources**, enabling a comprehensive view of the business, whereas operational databases are more focused on specific, real-time transactional data.
- **Visualization in operational databases is difficult** because the data is not structured for analysis or reporting, whereas a DWH is built specifically for easier and more effective **data visualization**.
- **Operational databases store real-time data** that supports immediate business operations, while a **DWH stores historical data** that is better suited for in-depth analysis.
- **DWH analysis is typically more accurate** because the data is cleaned, aggregated, and transformed for analysis, whereas operational databases focus on real-time, transactional accuracy.
___________
## What are the advantages of Data Warehouse? 👍
- strategic questions can be answered by studying trends.
- DWH is faster and more accurate.
- DWH is not a product, it's designed and implemented according to the company's requirements.

## Properties of a Data Warehouse
- **Subject oriented**
Data is stored and categorized based on business subject not the application.

> 	**Example**: Instead of having separate tables for "customer orders" in the sales application and "customer details" in the CRM system, a DWH will integrate these into a **subject-oriented model** like "Customer," where you can see all related data (e.g., purchases, demographics, interactions) in one place.

- **Integrated**
Data comes from various sources and stored in one place

- **Time variant**
Data is stored a a series of snapshots each representing a time period

- **Non-volatile** 
Typically, The data store is not updated or deleted.

_________
# ETL -> Extract, Transform and Load
- It's process of extracting the data from various sources, transforming this data to meet the requirement and then loading it into data warehouse.

_______
# What's a data mart? 🛒
- It's a smaller version of data warehouse
- it store data about a single subject
- since it's about a single subject, it pulls data from limited number of resources
- time taken to build data mart is shorter than DWH
- data marts are there for data security and data integrity
## Types of data mart

- data is extracted from multiple sources.
- then ETL will be performed on the extracted data
- and will go to staging area in the staging database which is a temporary data before going to data warehouse, this is present in the etl tool.
- data warehouse can be then divided into data marts
