# Introduction to containers and VMs

## What's virtualization? 
- Virtualization is the process of simulating hardware and software in a virtual environment.
- Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of an actual piece of technology, such as an operating system, a server, a storage device or a network resource.

## What's a virtual machine?
 - it's a software based computer/server.

## How does virtualization happen?

- by using a hypervisor; it creates and runs the virtualization.
- hypervisor allocates and manage the sharing of machine resources .
- hypervisor layer is the layer that allows the OS of VMs interact with the machine actual resources.
### Types of hypervisor

#### Type one: hypervisor
- it's installed directly on the bare-metal hardware.
it's like three software based servers.

#### Type two: hypervisor
- it's installed on top of an existing operating system.

## Advantages of virtualization üëç
- saves money from maintenance and management
- uses the full capability of the computing device
- portable
## Disadvantages of virtualization üëé
- consumes alot of disk space (each VM has it's own OS)
- slow boot time
- requires licenses for each OS

## What's a container? 
it's an application that's packed with all the 1. files 2. dependencies 3. configs 
needed for the application to run.

**or**

it's bundled up with everything the application needed to run on any computing device without having to add anything to that computer.
- the leading software that is used to create, manage and run containers is **docker**.

container engine: it unpacks the bundle of the container and hands them off to the core of the OS; which is the kernel.
- the container must work on the same OS as the one that it was packaged on.

## Difference between VMs and Containers
![Pasted image 20241013200023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462390c3-2e99-47ff-9f23-d3723999c4c1)



#### 1. VMs 
- Virtual machines virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers through the hypervisor which sits between the hardware and the virtual machine.
- Each virtual machine runs its guest operating system.
- The hypervisor is the key to enabling virtualization.

#### 2. Containers
- containers virtualize the¬†operating system¬†(typically¬†Linux¬†or¬†Windows) so each individual container contains¬†_only_¬†the application and its libraries and¬†dependencies.

Containers have a smaller footprint than virtual machines. This is because containers share the host operating system's kernel, while virtual machines each have their own kernel. As a result, containers can start and stop faster, and they use fewer resources.Virtual machines are isolated from each other, which can help to prevent attacks from spreading between guests.

Here's a table comparing **containers** and **virtual machines (VMs)** based on several features:

| **Feature**          | **Container**                               | **Virtual Machine**              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Operating system** | Shares the host operating system's kernel   | Has its own kernel               |
| **Portability**      | More portable                               | Less portable                    |
| **Speed**            | Faster to start up and shut down            | Slower to start up and shut down |
| **Resource usage**   | Uses fewer resources                        | Uses more resources              |
| **Use cases**        | Good for portable and scalable applications | Good for isolated applications   |

## Things you need to have for a Virtual Machine
1. **Hypervisor** 
it's responsible for creating abstraction layer that allows virtual machines (VMs) to interact with the physical hardware of a host system.

2. **Management software**
it's responsible for the `devops` of the virtual machine, `dev` for creating,installing and building the virtual machine and `ops` for administration purposes like starting,pausing, deleting and running the virtual machine.

**for example: VM hypervisor and VM workstation.**

### Why Did we Need the Concept of Containers?

- **Resource Efficiency**: Virtual machines (VMs) consume a lot of resources because each requires a full operating system, leading to inefficiencies, especially when running multiple VMs on the same host.
    
- **Simplified Application Deployment**: Containers allow us to **deploy bundles of applications** without needing to know the installation details or underlying configurations. They encapsulate everything the application needs, making deployment faster and more manageable, regardless of the environment.

# Concept of base disks in VMs
- When creating a VM template, a **virtual hard disk** (VHD) is used as the **base disk**. This base disk contains the core operating system and software configuration.
    
- When you start creating copies (or **linked clones**) of that template, a **differential hard disk** (also known as a **delta disk** or **differencing disk**) is created. This disk only stores changes made to the original base disk, while the base disk acts as the parent.
    
- If you take **snapshots** of the VM you're working on, another differential hard disk is generated for each snapshot. Each of these disks tracks the changes made after the snapshot.
    
- When you delete a snapshot, the VM reverts to the state of the last differential disk or returns to the previous snapshot, discarding the changes tracked by the deleted snapshot.

## In the context of **containers**, a similar concept exists

Containers use **base images** and **layered filesystems** to achieve the same goals as base disks and differential disks in VMs. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:
### 1. **Base Image**:

- A **base image** in containers is similar to a **base disk** in virtual machines. It contains the core operating system(some OS specifications in the user mode) needed for a container to run. For example, a base image could include a minimal Linux OS 
    
- Multiple containers can share the same base image, which saves space and makes container creation faster.
### 2. **Layered Filesystem**:

- Containers use a **layered filesystem** where each layer represents a set of changes or additions to the base image. 
- When you modify or add files in a container, a new layer (or overlay) is created on top of the base image. This is similar to the concept of **differential disks** in VMs.

#### once done adding everything needed, a container image is formed.
_______________
#### A container image is just like a VM template; a read only container.
_____________
#### Example:
if you want to deploy an office application and its only requirement is to run on Fedora, 
you don‚Äôt need a full operating system. You only need the **Linux kernel** and the specific **Fedora user space** components required to make the application work. In this case, your container would include just the minimal components: the **Linux kernel** (provided by the host) and the necessary Fedora packages and libraries.

## Containerization Concept in the Kernel

- **Kernels** provide containerization through two core mechanisms: **control groups (c-groups)** and **namespaces**, which enable process isolation and resource management.
    
    - **c-groups** (control groups) are responsible for **limiting and distributing system resources** (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth) among different groups of processes.
    
    - **Namespaces** create **isolated environments for processes**, limiting what each process can see or access (e.g., network interfaces, file systems, process IDs). This ensures that each container believes it‚Äôs running in its own dedicated system, even though it shares the underlying kernel.
